- The original PDB files are located somewhere else in eredmithrim:
	ln -s /home/wimi/lvs/ESA_Projects/bioinfo/docking_src/PDBs/ PDBs_link

- Every complex has its own folder. AutoDock and ofdock use the files 
  within the "derived" folder.

- Output log file names:
	AutoDock: 1hvr.dlg
	ofdock:   1hvr.dlg (-resnam is needed)

- To avoid misunderstanding: the folder "input_data" contains
  ligand and protein files corresponding to the complex "1hvr",
  which were already processed by AutoDockTooks. This was provided by EVOPRO.
