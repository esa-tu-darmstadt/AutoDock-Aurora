This explains how experiments are performed.

----------------------------------
PDBs_exp
Initial "Experiments"
Folder contains the results of running "ofdock" againts many protein-ligand complexes.
It is ONLY used to verify the functional correctness of the design as other processes might
have been run at the same time "ofdock" was running.

IMPORTANT:
THIS IS EMPTY FOR THE AMD VERSION AS VERIFICATION WAS ALREADY DONE IN EREDMITHRIM USING OFDOCK_INTEL.
----------------------------------

PDBs_val
"Validation"
Real measurements of performance and power.
No other processes were running besides "ofdock" and "power_gov"
