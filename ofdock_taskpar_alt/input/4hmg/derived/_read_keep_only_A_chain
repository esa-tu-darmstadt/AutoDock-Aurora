This ligand SIA (O-SIALIC ACID) contains three chains: A, C, E.
Inspecting visually reveals that these three chains are the same in terms 
of bonds and number of atoms. Their position is different.

In adt4, chains C and E were removed and only chain A is kept for further analysis.
In adt4, use the dashboard to select the chains to be deleted.

The original ligand (.pdb) contains three chains, while the modified one (.pdbqt) has only one.
