In order to estimate power, it is possible to use `Power Play`.

First go inside the folder generated by AOC:

```zsh
[lvs@celebdil docking]$ pwd       
/home/wimi/lvs/ofdock_altera/ofdock_taskpar_alt/bin_hw/docking
```

Then run:

```zsh
quartus_pow top.qpf
```

The output will be large. Here is an extract of the initial output and final results:
