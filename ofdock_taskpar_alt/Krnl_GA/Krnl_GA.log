                                   *** Optimization Report ***                                        

Kernels that do not use any work-item built-in functions, such as get_global_id(), are compiled for single
work-item execution (a task). Otherwise, a kernel is compiled as an ND-Range.

For tasks, the compiler will attempt to pipeline every loop in the kernel to allow multiple iterations of
the loop to execute concurrently. If some loops are not pipelined, or not pipelined well, you may not get
good performance.

For ND-Range kernels, the loops are not pipelined. Instead, they are built to accept multiple work-items
simultaneously. Kernel throughput is usually reduced by the largest total number of iterations of nested
loops. A large number of threads is usually required to efficiently utilize ND-Range kernels.

=========================================================================================================
The kernel is compiled as an ND-Range.

The kernel has a required work-group size of (1, 1, 1).

Loop Report:

 + Loop "Block97" (file Krnl_Conform.cl line 47)
 | Pipelined with successive iterations launched every cycle.
 |  
 | The compiler has limited the maximum number of simultaneous iterations of this loop to 16
 | to provide a good trade-off between area and throughput due to local memory accesses which are
 | iteration independent. If you want more fine grained control, please use the
 | #pragma max_concurrency <N> on the loop. A higher value may provide higher throughput
 | while a lower value will provide area benefits.
 |  
 | Iterations executed serially across the regions listed below.
 | Only a single loop iteration will execute inside the listed regions.
 | This will cause performance degradation unless the regions are pipelined well
 | (can process an iteration every cycle).

 | NOT pipelined due to: 
 |   Loop exit condition unresolvable at iteration initiation.
 |   Simplify loop exit condition to fix this problem.
 |   See "Unable to Resolve Loop Exit Condition at Iteration Initiation" section of the Best Practices Guide for more information.
 |   Not pipelining this loop will most likely lead to poor performance.

 |-+ Loop "Block112" (file Krnl_IntraE.cl line 44)
 |   Pipelined well. Successive iterations are launched every cycle.

 |   
 |-+ Loop "Block114" (file Krnl_IntraE.cl line 69)
     Pipelined with successive iterations launched every 17 cycles due to: 
          
         Data dependency on variable intraE  (file Krnl_IntraE.cl line 36)
